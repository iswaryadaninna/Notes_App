HTML:
A <textarea> is provided for the user to input their note.
An Add Note button allows users to add new notes to the list.
The notes are displayed in a <div> with the class notes-list.

CSS:
Styles the page with a clean and simple design.
The notes are displayed in boxes with a "Delete" button for each note. There's also an "Edit" button to modify the note.

JavaScript:
The notes are stored in localStorage, which allows the notes to persist even after refreshing the page.
The app supports add, edit, and delete functionalities.
renderNotes() function is responsible for displaying the notes in the list.
saveNotes() function saves the notes array to localStorage.


How It Works:

When the user adds a note, it is saved in localStorage and rendered in the list.
The user can click on the "Delete" button to remove a note or "Edit" to modify it.
The notes are stored in localStorage and will persist after refreshing the page, allowing users to come back and view their notes later.
You can further enhance this app by:
Adding a confirmation popup when deleting a note.
Styling the notes with more colors or different fonts.
Limiting the character count for each note.
Allowing users to filter or search notes.
This is a simple yet effective way to create a notes application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with localStorage.
